    <p>Hi, I'm Colin. I'm a recent Engineering Physics graduate who's currently developing web applications for PNI Digital Media.</p>

    <p>Previously, I worked as a web developer at Ingenium Technologies doing full-stack feature development for an enterprise lead management application. Other work experiences I've had include researching cement image analysis algorithms in Japan, measuring power consumption on smartphones running Angry Birds, and designing interfaces for demonstrating ship detection algorithms.</p>

    <p>I've built a whole slew of applications to learn new technologies and develop my technical skills. My latest application involves combining multiple geographically-focused real-time data sources (such as Twitter) and processing the data (using clustering, sentiment analysis, etc.) such that users can engage with the data and discover interesting relationships themselves.</p>

    <p>I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities in software development. My greatest strengths lie in my generalist technical background and my "get 'er done" attitude; if you need someone who has previous development experience, learns quickly, and can get things done, send me an email at <%= mail_to "colinmleung@gmail.com" %>.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
